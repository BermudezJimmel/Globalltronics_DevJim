Create one readme file for each data file, whenever possible.
It is also appropriate to describe a “dataset” that has multiple, related, identically formatted files, or files that are logically grouped together for use (e.g. a collection of Matlab scripts). When appropriate, also describe the file structure that holds the related data files. See Example 2 for describing grouped or multiple files.
 
Name the readme so that it is easily associated with the data file(s) it describes
Write your readme document as a plain text file
To avoid proprietary formats such as MS Word whenever possible. Format the readme document so it is easy to understand (e.g. separate important pieces of information with blank lines, rather than having all the information in one long paragraph).
 
Format multiple readme files identically. 
Present the information in the same order, using the same terminology.
 
Use standardized date formats. 
Suggested format: W3C/ISO 8601 date standard, which specifies the international standard notation of YYYYMMDD or YYYYMMDDThhmmss.
 
Follow the domain conventions of your discipline for taxonomic, geospatial and geologic names and keywords.
Whenever possible, use terms from standardized taxonomies and vocabularies, a few of which are listed below.
